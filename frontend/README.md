# Vue Invoice App

This client is a customized template and is not meant to demonstrate my frontend abilities.

The client is meant to serve as a gateway to the api functionalities as well as demonstrate how to multi-deploy.

 You can keep track of your personal invoices with this app. You can create a new invoice, save it as a draft or as pending, mark pending invoices as paid and edit any draft or pending invoices. Also you can filter the invoices by their draft/pending/paid status.

You can see the [live demo here.](https://kerosine-invoicing.kerosinecoding.com/)

This as a Full Stack Web Application with NodeJS/Expressjs server and Mongodb/Postgresql Database.

This project is built with:

- Frontend Framework: [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)
- Created with: [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/),
- For state management: [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/),
- For routing: [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/),
